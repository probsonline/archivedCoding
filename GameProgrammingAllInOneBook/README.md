a google search based link that can be found to the old book is available at 
https://doc.lagout.org/Others/Game%20Development/Programming/Game%20Programming%20All%20in%20One.pdf

Don't know if the book is still in print or no.

Most of the project files seem to be built with Visual Studio 6 (1998 version)
